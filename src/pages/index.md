  title: Why OTL?
  description: >
    Our Traces Logged. One True Love. Obscene Transcending Losers... I don't
    know haha, I just thought it'd make sense to create this blog for us and dub
    it in short as OTL for now because it goes way back to our origins. Of
    course, I'd love for you and I to one day create a travel blog that we can
    blast to the public... but for now, this is for you and I to lay our fondest
    memories. I love ya, dorkie ^.^

  I picked OTL because this acronym represents us on so many levels. All the
  goofy times, the sexual ><, and the rough times where it's like we were
  metaphorically on our knees. We've been OTL for each other before we ever
  realized. Our story is unique and deserves to be documented, so enjoy love,
  and make sure to write lots! I wrote some to start, have fun reading :D
