  title: Why OTL?
  description: >
    Our Traces Logged. One True Love. Obscene Transcending Losers... I don't know haha, I just thought it'd make sense to create this blog for us and dub it in short as OTL for now because it goes way back to our origins. Of course, I'd love for you and I to one day create a travel blog that we can blast to the public... but for now, this is for you and I to lay our fondest memories. I love ya, dorkie ^.^

  I picked OTL because this acronym represents us on so many levels. All the goofy times, the sexual ><, and the rough times where it's like we were metaphorically on our knees. We've been OTL for each other before we ever realized. Our story is unique and deserves to be documented, so enjoy love, and make sure to write lots! I wrote some to start, have fun reading :D

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
