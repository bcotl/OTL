### Silly

The first thing that comes to mind for me is this. We're in every sense of the word 'Silly'. From day one, our interactions were not only silly in nature but also silly in behavior. We acted really funny towards one another and over time it became very prevalent to me that I would always find humor with you. I'm funnier though :'D

### One of a Kind

Each unique in our own ways. But even more unique together. Cut from a different cloth yet we share a beautiful connection. The things we do agree on get amplified... and the things that don't? Well they raise a conversation and often times we influence each other in the most opportune of times. Our energy is 'One of a Kind'.

### Ridiculous 

The existence of us is really 'Ridiculous'. Think about the whole thing. How we came to be. How there were plenty of forces against us yet somehow we still prevailed and continue to do so. We also ridiculous because we're roffin, I mean... that's pretty much a fusion of silly and one of a kind LOL. I'm pretty sure no couple out there is like us ._.

### Ambitious

I don't know if it's the timing or what it is. But the amount of drive we currently possess is baffling. We both know what we want in life. And we're bullishly working towards our dreams in hopes of making them a reality. I'm proud of the both of us and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for us. OTLOTL
