This day was so nerve-wracking baby. I was legit on edge for the whole week. I knew I wanted to make you mine. Every ounce of my being was telling me, "DO IT!" 

## April 26th, 2019

I remember this day pretty well. I picked you up at the airport and like every other time where we went ages apart... we quickly jumped each other. We were being all lovey dovey in front of everyone as if no one around us existed. Because that's exactly what it was in that moment. I saw the love of my life, and I couldn't contain myself ><\
\
Afterwards, I brought you to a sushi restaurant nearby where I experienced Uni for the first time ever. (One of our conversations a long long time prior lead me to planning this because you said you wanted to see me try uni because you really like it - I really liked it too!) You stared at me while I ate it, it was kinda funny LOL. And you expected me to hate it but I didn't hahaha\
\
Eventually we ended up at the beach, Heisler Park (My favorite place down there)...\
It made sense to me to ask you out here because you're my favorite person. We walked the beach and somehow ended up in a semi-isolated corner. Well kinda, LOL there were some people not too far from us literally staring at us be gay the entire time AHAHAHA I'm pretty sure they saw us grinding up on each other being spicy too XD

;.; I danced for you, and it was to a song that I felt represented us well. It was a sad song... but my feelings poured into that piece. You enjoyed it and was smiling and reacting the whole time which had me even more nervous because I'm like dam... you're stunning :0 

Then I finished dancing and you came up to embrace me but you felt me hella shaking, and I'm sure you felt I was still really anxious... and in that moment I did the thing that had us embark on an entirely new journey. I asked you to be my girlfriend. And you granted my wish. My love, my baby unikone cwystal, I love you so, and I can't wait to see what's in store for us. I love ya dork, and you're my absolute favorite. Don't you ever forget, even with that Alzheimer's, or you will feel the wrath of my reminders!
