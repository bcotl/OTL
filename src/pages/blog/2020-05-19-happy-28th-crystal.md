**I decided I should**\
\
Life is so different without you but this is our reality now...\
but that really shouldn't mean we need to severe the time we spent together

I will gift you four things today

Here's a video to ***commemorate*** our beautiful time together\
I swear *twin flames* is what we were. I'll never forget how we felt

Here's what I painted about a month ago at paint night with Byro, Alice, and his housemates\
Ugh it's ugly but I ***love*** it. It was inspired by my simp ass mood

Here's a poem I wrote as I was on a plane to SoCal almost two months ago because I was missing ***you***

> *Clouds*
>
> Falling into the abyss,\
> succumbed to tragedy
>
> Sifting into the spring mist,\
> blessed by rhapsody\
> \
> Ruin in minutes,\
> what took days to create\
> \
> Thoughts of us,\
> overtaken by sun's radiate\
> \
> *Clouds*\
> \
> Beautiful yet fragile,\
> never full, eternal
>
> Evaporate, blessing the\
> atmosphere with life's nectar
>
> Dissipate, insignificant?\
> no, as each carries its accord\
> \
> We were clouds,\
> there was purpose\
> in us, our very beings\
> saved with the products\
> of our dutiful ruckus\
> \
> Destined to dissolve\
> Stop us? Impossible 

<br></br>I'm without you but I will never forget you. Months before we became a couple on the brink of us ending our friendship, I asked you if you would forget me. And you told me that you wouldn't. You told me that I gave you such fond memories and you felt blessed to have met me. You told me how much you appreciated our conversations every day and how different I made you feel. You also told me, that I would move on easy. You told me that I'd eventually forget you and that you would never forget me. Crystal, I don't know about you but the part of me forgetting you is false. There's absolutely no way I'll ever forget you. You're my favorite of all time. My awkward, dorky, silly alpaca unicorn. And I'll always remember you as such. I'll always remember how magical we were. I'm without you but I will never forget you. \
\
*Until we meet again,* \
*stay strong, take care of yourself, be the awesome person that you are, and continue to light up the world with that beautiful smile of yours. Again happy birthday Crystal, I wish for all the happiness in the world for you. Even if it's not with me, I wish nothing but the best for you. There's always a happy ending, if it's not happy, it's not the end.*\

Y*our frenchy fries,*\
