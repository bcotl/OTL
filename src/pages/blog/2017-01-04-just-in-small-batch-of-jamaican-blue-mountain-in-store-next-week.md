  I don't necessarily remember when we took this pic or what transpired that
  day...

  But what I do know is there were many days like this. Being with you and
  Butters feels the coziest. It feels so warm. So homely. So wholesome ^.^

;.; Unfortunately I have Alzheimer's so I can't recall when this was taken :<\

But, look at this pic! It's so precious :( It makes me miss the days where I lived with you. Seeing you and Butters daily felt so right. 

## Butters is a goofball

He's so funny dude, he's literally so content when we're together. Like he doesn't care what we do, he's just happy existing next to us. I'm sure he feels how much we love each other... and sometimes he even gets lucky and we both viciously pet him at the same time. He really can't handle it dude LOL. He probably feels like the luckiest pupper when we're together haha xD

## Moments so Simple yet so Whole

Although I appreciate when we get to play by going out and doing stuff; what makes me feel like the most blessed person in the world isn't in the activity but rather who I'm spending it with. Nothing makes me happier than being able to spend time with you and Butters. 

That doesn't mean I don't want to do so much more with you though... I DO! But just thinking about how I feel now, not doing so much with you yet feeling so strongly about the time we do spend together. I know this is something special. Every moment with you makes me so heppi :0 

Your smile/laughter is adorable and it makes me feel like the luckiest man ever when i succeed in making you cheeesseee. And I love embracing you, nothing feels as right. That's why the distance and time apart makes me feel queasy. That's why when we go long times without seeing each other you see me a bit more nervous than usual >< It's because I've missed you so much and I literally can't handle it when we're back together.\
\
I can't wait for the day when I'm able to take you out and spoil you heavily. Those days will be golden, but the days right now? They're shiny too because days don't seem so blue, especially when I'm with you. :* We feel towards each other like Butters feels towards us!
