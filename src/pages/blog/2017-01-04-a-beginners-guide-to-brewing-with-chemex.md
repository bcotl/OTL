HAHAHAHA Alpacas are so funny looking dude, and they're so funny personality-wise.

## Our kind LOL

They're oh so awkward and hilarious too ahaha, they're like us! Those things are so dumb dude they kept tryna eat your hair. >:( I kept having to protect it LOL. I'm like dude no that's my baby's hair hahaha. \

I really enjoyed visiting this alpaca farm actually. We're such animal loving ppl, baby. It's awesome xD I hope we get to visit more places like this in the future. We definitely still need to visit the aquarium.

I also really like this picture, because you're smile's so cute and the alpaca looks really funny :D:
