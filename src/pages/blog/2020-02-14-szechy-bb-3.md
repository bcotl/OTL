#### January 19th, 2020

A day unlike our usual weekend hangouts couped up in my room/Daly City.

We met in Palo Alto to study. Such nerds for real, but this is what our lives have become, and I think it's beautiful! We're adulting super hard, and I know the both of us do envy those that are able to play more than we do... but at the end of the day, we're going to be in a much better place in the future because of the things we do now. 

But all is not lost. We still find youth in each others' company. Well I can't speak on your behalf, but I know for myself I really like just existing next to you >< Being in that coffee shop next to you was all I needed that Sunday afternoon to bring me that soothing bliss as we chugged along mentally. \
\
Shortly after I failed and we ended up over the bridge on the way to Jensen's pizza shop when he wasn't even there. Oof. But it was a blessing in disguise because we got to eat at that Szechuan restaurant. We enjoyed a lot of laughs per usual but the funniest moment of all was when we got wrecked eating the spicy stuff LOLLL you looked so wrecked it was kinda adorable how miserable you were I'm sorry XD\
\
You got to drive my car later that evening. You were probably destroying my car but you had a good time doing it, I guess LOL so that's okay. You'll get better!\
\
Then we shot pool and I completely whooped your butt, you'd say otherwise though :rollseyes: . NGL though I couldn't help but stare at how you looked with your jacket off >< Ugh if we were playing pool somewhere more isolated, you'd be on that table >:D hehe
