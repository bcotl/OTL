On 2/14/2020, aka Valentine's day, you came to my work and then you had to do WEB which we just did in some random parking lot LOL. Then we went to a nearby Target where we napped and then frolicked around Target! I like frolicking with you :D 

Then we went to a chil Thai place to eat, where we lost the next WEB LOL :( I wanted to spend more time with you, but unfortunately I had to go ;.; 

The next morning I left a little earlier to get to your place, and then you took me to a surprise!! A beach in Pacifica which was super booyeeteeful :000 And it was Butter's first time at a beach!!

We walked around the beach and butters kept stepping on my sueded shoes LOL which you kindly cleaned for me ^__^ 

It was really fun being at the beach with you and watching how retarded our dog can be baby ^___^ Thanks so much for taking me!!

And then we got some groceries from safeway and started cooking. Little did I know that my baby would make me SUUUUCH an AMAZING lunch/dinner :0000 You made fruit cobbler, garlic noodles, and BACON rolled steak!!! ;.; It was soooo yummy and it was the best food that anyone has ever prepared for me ;.; you tried so hard bb and it was so good ^_\_^\_^___^
